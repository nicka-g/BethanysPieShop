# BethanysPieShop

This is a project I worked with while practicing the fundamentals of ASP.NET Core. I followed a course in Pluralsight and this is where it led me.

The system is a Pie shop that lets customers browse various Pies with different categories, read its descriptions, view the Price, add to cart and check them out. The page also has a separate Contact page. The "home" page features "Pies of the Week", but if the user wanted to find a particular Pie, they can do so in the search tab that is API based.

On the checkout page, the user will have to answer a few fields before submitting a form that is implemented with validations.


Technologies I have learned and used:
- MVC Framework
- Data Migration
- ASP.Net Core Blazor
- Razor Pages, Views, Layout
- ASP.Net Core Identity
- Entity framework Core
- Tag helpers
- etc.

NOTE: this is only 90% finished since I left the authorization and authentication for Login undone. In addition, the site is not published.
